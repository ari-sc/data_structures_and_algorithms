/* Advantages of array-based stack:
1. Random access in O(1) time
2. Easy to implement
3. Less memory overhead (no pointers are used)
4. Stored in stack memory (faster access)

Disadvantages of array-based stack:
1. Fixed size
2. Insertion is expensive if stack is full
3. Memory is not dynamically allocated (wasted memory if stack is not full) */
